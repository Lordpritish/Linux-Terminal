What did I work on in the last three days?
   	- complete implementation of Move and Copy
	- changed Remove to be able to remove indirect ancestors
	- CRC cards for Remove, Move, Copy
	- J Unit testing for ChangeDirectory Remove, Move, Copy
   
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	

Am I blocked on anything?
